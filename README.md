Project Title: 
Rage & Romance - A Gamified Relationship Tracker

Project Type: Frontend Web Application( this is not to show skills, just a small vibe coding project)

Project Overview:**
Rage & Romance is an interactive, gamified web application built to help couples playfully track emotional ups and downs in their relationship. It allows users to log events that made them happy or upset, assign a score based on intensity, and maintain a running tally between two partners. The application presents a dual-column scorecard, a mood selector, witty messages, and persistent data storage to maintain logs across sessions.

Tech Stack:
- HTML5 Semantic structure with modular sections for scalable layout.
- CSS3: Responsive dark-mode styling with neon-glow aesthetics, flexbox-based dual columns, and interactive hover effects.
- JavaScript: Handles DOM manipulation, screen transitions, mood logic, score calculations, and witty feedback.
- LocalStorage API: Ensures all user inputs, scores, and logs persist even after refresh or revisiting.

Key Features:
- Clean, gamer-inspired UI with Orbitron font and glowing headers.
- Dual-column battle log for Player 1 and Player 2.
- Mood-based score assignment (positive for happy, negative for upset).
- Real-time winner declaration with a witty verdict.
- Full offline functionality using LocalStorage.
- Screen transitions mimicking game flows (Start > Mood > Rating > Scoreboard).
- Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile browsers.

Role & Contribution:
- Designed and developed the full frontend structure and user flow.
- Wrote modular, maintainable JavaScript for all interactive features.
- Applied UI/UX principles to create an engaging, gender-neutral design.
- Implemented persistent data storage and session restoration logic.

Outcome:
The project demonstrates both technical frontend skills and a strong sense of user experience design. It showcases my ability to turn creative concepts into functional web applications with clean code, modern styling, and persistent data handling.
